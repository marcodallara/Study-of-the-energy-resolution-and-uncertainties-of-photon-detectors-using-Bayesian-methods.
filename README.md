# Study-of-the-energy-resolution-and-uncertainties-of-photon-detectors-using-Bayesian-methods.

We studied energy-resolution-and-uncertainties-of-photon-detectors-using-Bayesian-methods using R. Specifically, the inferences were all made with rJAGS, a Gibbs sampler(MCMC method) for R.

1. We inferred the FWHM and centroid for Na22, Co60, Cs137, Am241 using different background functions.
2. We calibrated the detector with a linear fit between CHANNEL and True Energies
3. We inferred the Fano factors using a model for the FWHM
4. We compared Ge and NaI detector
